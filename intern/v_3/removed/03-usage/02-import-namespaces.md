# Import Namespaces

Before you can use the Ads Kit Plugin classes, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your script file. Add the following lines at the top of your script:

```csharp
using VoxelBusters.CoreLibrary;
using VoxelBusters.AdsKit;
```

This gives access to **AdsManager** and **AdServices** classes provided by the plugin. Additionally, you can access other useful classes and interfaces in the plugin.
